I am currently a Research Assistant under [Prof. Zhijing Jin](https://zhijing-jin.com/) at the University of Toronto and a Project Collaborator at the Vector Institute. My recent research focuses on improving AI safety, adversarial robustness and multi-agent systems, with the broader goal of developing socially beneficial and reliable AI systems. Outside of research, I enjoy playing the piano and exploring nature.
